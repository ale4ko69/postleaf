# A note from the author

Postleaf ‚Äî at least in its current form ‚Äî has been discontinued. In the future, I'd like to bring it back as something different. Maybe an open source project. Maybe a SaaS product. I'm not sure at this point.

The world still needs a simple platform to encourage blogging and the decentralization of publishing. Unfortunately, This version of Postleaf didn't fill that gap because it was too difficult and expensive for the majority of users to install and host. Aside from that, the world of web hosting has changed significantly in recent years.

For now, I'm taking some time to focus on other projects and interests. I hope to revisit Postleaf again when the time is right for me, but I'm not exactly sure when that might be.

That said, I'm archiving the Postleaf repository. Anyone is welcome to fork the project and carry the torch, but I'm hanging onto the "Postleaf" name, U.S. trademark, and website, so new maintainers will need to release it under a different name.

Thanks for the many years of encouragement. While my vision for Postleaf wasn't fully realized, I've learned so much from this project and its community. I'm still excited for Postleaf's future.

## Documentation

Detailed instructions for installing, updating, and creating themes can be found at [postleaf.org/docs](https://www.postleaf.org/docs).

## Installation for Developers

This guide assumes you're installing Postleaf locally for development purposes. Please make sure the following dependencies are installed on your system before continuing:

- Node 7 (lower versions have not been tested and are not supported)
- npm
- Git
- SQLite 3
- GraphicsMagick

**You will also need access to an SMTP server for sending emails.** Otherwise, you won't be able to create users, perform password resets, etc. If you don't already have a transactional email service, the folks over at Discourse have put together a great [list of email providers](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/docs/INSTALL-email.md) ‚Äî many of which offer free plans.

To install Postleaf in a development environment, follow these instructions.

1. Open a terminal and clone the project and default theme:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/ale4ko69/postleaf.git
  git clone git clone https://github.com/ale4ko69/casper2-theme.git themes/casper2-theme
  ```
2. Make a copy of `.env.example` and name it `.env`. Open it and change `AUTH_SECRET` to a random string to secure your app. Then add your SMTP credentials so email can be sent. You also need to set the `APP_URL` to `http://localhost:3000/`.
3. Install dependencies and run the build script:
  ```
  npm install
  sudo npm install -g gulp-cli
  gulp build
  ```
4. Now launch the app:
  ```
  node app.js
  ```

At this point, you should be able to see Postleaf running by pointing your browser to `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Themes

To install a theme, simply add it to the `themes` directory. There are a few additional themes located in the [main repo](https://github.com/Postleaf).

To learn how to create your own theme, refer to the [theme documentation](https://www.postleaf.org/themes-overview).
